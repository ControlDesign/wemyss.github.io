			<p>Hi, I'm Sam! I am a final year Software Engineering student at UNSW who loves solving complex problems and exploring the world around me.</p>

			<p>Growing up on a farm I've always been a bit more connected to the environment than most, which is why I hope to build software that can help tackle one of the biggest problem of our time - climate change.</p>

			<p>Day to day I like to hack away at side projects to pick up new skills, sharpen old ones, or maybe just for a little bit of fun...</p>

			<p>In my spare time I like going on hikes in the mountains, play video games and doing something other than uni work :D. Other random things I do include archery, snowboarding and gardening.</p>

			<p>If you want to get in touch - just click on one of the links below. Otherwise have a great day!</p>
