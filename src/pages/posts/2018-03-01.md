### Day 0
- Landed in Queenstown
- Dinner at Winnie‚Äôs. Very filling and yummy. 9/10
- Stayed at Jason‚Äôs in Queenstown

### Day 1
- Ben Lomond walk (followed road up a bit for more direct path). 10/10. Full day walk. View is fantastic - clear day required, sunset would be epic (need head torch for descent). Can take gondola for shorter trip
- One Mile Track is good on the way down from Ben Lomonds. Follows old water pipes from mountains. Cool little falls and quiet old walk.
- Botanical gardens walk, view of pier/lights and lake/sky/mountains. Good at night. Cuban burrito

### Day 3
- 4:45am start. Kayak at Milford cancelled üò•. GoOrange is apparently a good cruise - didn't decide to join in on the cruise but.

- Milford lookout walk behind the cafe. Gets you up a bit higher for a nice view of Sound
- Old Postman‚Äôs track is on your right after 3rd single lane bridge coming out of Milford Sound. Little old track (not sure how far it goes) but first 10m are gorgeous with old swing bridge and the secluded area as there isn‚Äôt a sign for it.
- The Chasm - 10mins from postman‚Äôs there‚Äôs a big car park and a nice short loop track that takes you to some mega rapids through solid rock slabs. Really cool to see in person the power of water, after rains it‚Äôs even more so.
- Lake Marian. Did first 10mins including swing bridge and waterfalls lookout - worth it. Not sure on full walk, if you have time would be worth otherwise do the next one...
- Key Summit. 3hr return walk (plus 1hr for nature walk on top - 100% worth). Gradual ascent for 1hr then steep zig zag ascent with gorgeous views for 20min.
